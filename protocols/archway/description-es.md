<p>
    Archway is a Cosmos-native incentivised smart contract chain that enables developers to easily deploy high-performance dapps that capture the value they create for the network. 
</p>

<p>
    As developers build and launch impactful dapps, they receive a proportional share of network fees, inflation, and premiums. 
</p>

<p>
    This shared revenue model enables dapps to access recurring value generation and participate in the upside of the underlying protocol.
