Juno is the permissionless neutral home of CosmWasm interoperable smart contracts and the InterWasm DAO. The ecosystem is pioneering CosmWasm development and adoption.

Juno as a layer 1 smart contract network solves the first generation smart contract bottlenecks which are limited scalability, high cost for deployment and execution and offers an easy environment for developers across the globe to deploy scalable, secure decentralized applications efficiently.

CosmWasm, enables WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machines (VMs). WebAssembly allows for software written in many languages to run securely on a blockchain. WASM serves as an intermediate language that compiles the developer’s language of choice into a portable virtual machine. This means that you can have a simple, secure and fast virtual machine set up to sandbox or partition your application’s actions for better testing, security, performance and speed.
