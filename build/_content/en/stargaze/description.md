Stargaze is a decentralized and community-owned network for NFTs. It is built as an app-specific Cosmos Proof-of_stake chain, running the Tendermint consensus engine. It’s goal is to be similar to OpenSea, except governed by a community via a curation DAO and a protocol DAO.

Stargaze will allow users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. It will also allow trading NFTs across other IBC-enabled chains. It will also interoperate with Ethereum over Gravity Bridge.

STARS is the native staking token that is used for:

Fees for processing transactions and storing data Running validator nodes on the network via staking STARS tokens Voting in governance for protocol upgrades and parameter changes Voting in the DAO to curate NFTs and fund creators Mint and bid on NFTs

Stargaze tools include:

Stargaze node software to run validators, full nodes, and perform command-line operations
