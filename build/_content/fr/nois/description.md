Launched in March 28, 2023, Nois Network is a proof-of-stake blockchain that aims to bring randomness (or noise) to the Cosmos ecosystem by providing a safe and secure entropy source and distributing randomness in the form of random beacons to other Cosmos-sdk blockchains via IBC.

More precisely, Nois provides public randomness, i.e. values that are unpredictable for all participants of the system but free to share once published.
